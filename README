*rought introduction to the project*

h1. MobilIT

This project aims to help citizens that are travelling all morning long to reach their job or something alike.

With the help of Open Data and related services, MobilIT tries to provide estimates on several transport costs in time, CO2, length, money and so on.

Transports forecasted are :
* common transports like Buses, Trams, Trains
* Car
* Cycle Park (rentals)

Other ones might be integrated further, like carpooling, car-sharing or other private (for now) services.

h2. Open Data

MobilIT will base its computation on data or services that are open, Open Street Map is an example, but we'll also use traffic jam data (real time).

h2. Outcomes

What the user will have in hands after having entered his travel (using maps, address forms, ...), it will get a comparison table between all transports that he envisions to use.
